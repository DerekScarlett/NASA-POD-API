How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API, Json

With this app I have a input box that is within a form that will allo me to press enter on my keyboard and it will take that value. Will I press enter it activates a click event that will take my value that I got from the input box to acces my API that will respond with the photo of the day that was for the date entered and append it to the DOM.

Optimizations
(optional)

If I had a chance to go back and work on it I would like to use the endpoints for longitude and latitude to get more accurate pictures.

Lessons Learned:
I learned how to use enpoints to access specific data from APIs.
